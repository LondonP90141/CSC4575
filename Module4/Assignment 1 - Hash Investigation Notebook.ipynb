    "   - Detecting accidental errors?  \n",
    "   - Detecting malicious tampering?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Does having a strong avalanche effect **by itself** guarantee that a hash function is collision-resistant?  \n",
    "   Briefly explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answers here:\n",
    "1. For a 256-bit hash, the theoretically ideal expected number of output bits that change when I flip a single input bit is 128, because each output bit should change with probability 1/2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In my experiment, the average Hamming distance was 127.65 bits, which is very close to the ideal value of 128 bits. The difference from the theoretical ideal is only 0.35 bits. This small difference indicates that SHA-256 exhibits a strong avalanche effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A strong avalanche effect is important for detecting accidental errors because even a single-bit error in the input will produce a very different hash output, making it easy to detect data corruption. It is also important for detecting malicious tampering, since any intentional modification to the message, even a tiny one, will drastically change the hash and reveal that the message was altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Having a strong avalanche effect alone does not guarantee that a hash function is collision-resistant. Avalanche behavior ensures strong diffusion, but collision resistance requires that it be computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value. A hash function can demonstrate good avalanche properties yet still have structural weaknesses that allow collision attacks.\n",
